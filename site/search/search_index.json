She needs to know where every tool is, how to use it, and how to keep her workbench clean and organized. An auto mechanic can't tune an engine if he's fumbling to find the right wrench.</p> <p>Our workshop is the computer, but not the one you might be used to with icons and a mouse. Our professional workshop is the server. And the way we interact with this server, our set of professional tools, is the Command Line Interface (CLI).</p> <p>Key Term: The Command Line Interface (CLI)</p> <p>The CLI is a text-based interface used for running programs, managing computer files, and interacting with the operating system. It is the direct line of communication to the machine's core.</p> <p>Think of the graphical interface (windows, icons, your mouse) as a friendly, pre-packaged toolkit for everyday tasks. It's safe and easy. The command line, however, is the master's toolkit. It gives you direct, powerful, and precise control over the machine. It is faster, more versatile, and essential for automating tasks\u2014a key skill for any engineer.</p> <p>Your first day on the job isn't about building the final product. It's about getting your keys to the workshop and learning where the tools are.</p> <p>So, let's start with a foundational question. Forget computers for a moment.</p> Why is it more efficient for a master chef to shout '2-minute egg, sunny-side up!' to their line cook, rather than filling out a detailed paper form with checkboxes for every option? <p>You, the engineer, are the chef. The computer's operating system is your highly-trained line cook. The command line is the language you use to give orders.</p> <p>Filling out a form is like using your mouse to click through menus and windows. It's fine for one-off tasks, but imagine trying to serve 100 customers that way. You'd be hopelessly slow. Shouting clear, concise commands is the only way to operate at scale. This is why the command line is the professional's environment.</p> <pre><code>graph LR\n    subgraph \"The Professional's Workflow (High Speed, High Scale)\"\n        A(&lt;b&gt;Master Chef&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Engineer) -- Shouts Command --&gt; B(&lt;b&gt;Concise Language&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Command Line);\n        B -- Interpreted by --&gt; C(&lt;b&gt;Line Cook&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Operating System);\n        C -- Produces --&gt; D(&lt;b&gt;Perfect Dish&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Precise Action);\n    end\n\n    subgraph \"The Amateur's Workflow (Low Speed, Low Scale)\"\n        X(Home Cook&lt;br/&gt;The Casual User) -- Fills out Form --&gt; Y(Detailed Recipe Card&lt;br/&gt;Graphical Interface);\n        Y -- Followed by --&gt; C;\n    end\n\n    style A fill:#4CAF50,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px,color:#fff\n    style B fill:#2196F3,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px,color:#fff\n    style D fill:#4CAF50,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px,color:#fff</code></pre> <p>Our workshop is a Linux server. Linux is the dominant operating system for the servers that power the internet, from Google to Netflix to the smallest startups. Mastering its language is non-negotiable. The program you use to type these commands is called the terminal or shell.</p> <p>Let's learn our first three commands. They are the most fundamental. They answer three simple questions:</p> Question Command Analogy Where am I? <code>pwd</code> Checking your GPS coordinates.

In a graphical system, you might look at the top of a window to see the folder path, like <code>C:\\Users\\John\\Documents</code>.</p> <p>In the command line, we have a direct command for this. It is <code>pwd</code>. <code>pwd</code> stands for Print Working Directory. A \"directory\" is simply the professional's word for a folder.

(<code>ls</code>)","text":"<p>Now you know where you are. The next logical question is, \"What's in this folder?\" or \"What's in this directory?\" The command for this is <code>ls</code>. <code>ls</code> is short for list. It lists the contents (the files and sub-directories) of your current working directory.</p> <p>Imagine you are standing in a room (<code>pwd</code> told you which room). Typing <code>ls</code> is like turning on the lights to see all the furniture and doors in that room.</p> <p>Now, a slightly more advanced question. What if you wanted to know more than just the names of the files? What if you wanted to see details, like who owns the file, how big it is, and when it was last modified?</p> <p>This is a common need. The command line handles this with options or flags. An option modifies the behavior of a command. They usually start with a hyphen (<code>-</code>). For <code>ls</code>, a very common option is <code>-l</code> (for \"long\" format). So, you would type: <code>ls -l</code>. This gives you a detailed, long-form list.</p> <p>What do you predict would be the difference in output between typing <code>ls</code> and typing <code>ls -l</code>?</p> Simple List (<code>ls</code>)Detailed List (<code>ls -l</code>) <pre><code>$ ls\nDesktop  Documents  Downloads  Music  Pictures  Projects  Videos\n</code></pre> <pre><code>$ ls -l\ntotal 28\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 user user 4096 Sep 15 10:00 Desktop\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 user user 4096 Sep 15 10:00 Documents\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 user user 4096 Sep 15 10:00 Downloads\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 user user 4096 Sep 15 10:00 Music\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 user user 4096 Sep 15 10:00 Pictures\ndrwxr-xr-x 3 user user 4096 Sep 15 10:05 Projects\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 user user 4096 Sep 15 10:00 Videos\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"module0/lesson0.1_workshop/#concept-3-how-do-i-move-cd","title":"Concept 3: How do I move?

The command to move between directories is <code>cd</code>. <code>cd</code> stands for change directory.</p> <p>If <code>ls</code> shows you a directory named <code>projects</code>, you would type the following to enter it: <code>cd projects</code>. Your \"location\" in the terminal would now be inside the <code>projects</code> directory.</p> <p>Now, here's a crucial test of understanding. After you run <code>cd projects</code>, your cursor will just blink on a new line. The screen doesn't automatically tell you that you've moved.</p> <p>What two commands would you use, and in what order, to first confirm that you have successfully moved into the <code>projects</code> directory, and then to see what's inside it?</p> <p>The Engineer's Workflow: Act, Verify, Inspect</p> <p>This sequence\u2014Act, Verify, then Inspect\u2014is a fundamental pattern in engineering.
